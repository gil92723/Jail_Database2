FIX and make sure all entries make sense (as it is generated from CHATGPT) mainly make sure FK are pointing to the right PK of other tables ---> In proccess of fixing/adding attributes so gonna generate new entries later down the line after issues are resloved in ERD
- New columns/attributes already added
- Need to revaulate our PKs (mainly make PK shorter so easier to reference) we can keep FK for additional info
- Need to make changes to SQL create table code to reflect

Check over Alex's code
- Comments already on file

We found many errors/things that don't make sense in wire frame / ERD so we need make minor changes to ERD so that all wire functions work as intended
Do PL SQL part (pretty easy after ERD is fixed) ideas of what to do already generated
