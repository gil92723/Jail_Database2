FIX and make sure all entries make sense (as it is generated from CHATGPT) mainly make sure FK are pointing to the right PK of other tables ---> In proccess of fixing/adding attributes so gonna generate new entries later down the line after issues are resloved in ERD
- New columns/attributes already added
- 

Check over Alex's code

We found many errors/things that don't make sense in wire frame / ERD so we need make minor changes to ERD so that all wire functions work as intended
Do PL (pretty easy after ERD is fixed) ideas of what to do already generated
